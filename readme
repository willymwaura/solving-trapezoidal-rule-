 implementation of the trapezoidal rule in Python to approximate the area under a curve given a function f, the limits of integration a and b, and the number of intervals n:Here, f is a Python function that takes a single argument x and returns the value of the function being integrated at x. a and b are the lower and upper limits of integration, respectively, and n is the number of intervals used to approximate the area.

To use this function, you can define your own f function and call the trapezoidal_rule function with the appropriate arguments. For example, suppose we want to approximate the area under the curve y = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 1 using 10 intervals.
Then we can call the trapezoidal_rule function
This will output the approximate area under the curve, which should be 0.335
